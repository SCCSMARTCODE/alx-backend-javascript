# Welcome to the ALX-Backend JavaScript Repository!

This repository hosts the backend codebase for our ALX platform, built entirely in JavaScript. Here, we implement robust backend functionalities, including API endpoints, data handling, authentication, and more, to power our dynamic web applications.

## Our stack includes 
- Node.js for server-side JavaScript execution, 
- Express.js for creating RESTful APIs, 
- MongoDB for flexible and scalable data storage, and various npm packages for additional features and utilities.
